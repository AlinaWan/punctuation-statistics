# Punctuation Stats

**Punctuation Stats** is a Python command-line tool that extracts and analyzes all punctuation from a text file.  
It prints every punctuation mark in the order they appear, and then shows a frequency table (counts + percentages), sorted by most frequent first.  

This project was inspired by [just-the-punctuation](https://just-the-punctuation.vercel.app), a neat web tool for visualizing punctuation.  
However, that tool sometimes outputs more punctuation than your text actually contains â€” so I made my own, ensuring accurate results with no extra characters.
